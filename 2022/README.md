## Advent of code 2022
Advent of July in Rust :-)

This is a Rust project built using Cargo, the Rust package manager and build tool.

## Installation

To use these solutions, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
If you don't have them installed, you can download and install them from the
official Rust website:
[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have them installed, you can build the solutions with:
```
cargo build
```
After building, you can find each day's solution in target/debug path.
But before running that, read the next section!

## Usage
Each solution downloads the input itself. Therefore you need to set your AOC
session cookie for your puzzle input before running the code. After finding your
cookie, set it as:

```
export AOC_SESSION_COOKIE=your-session-cookie
```
Thats it, now you can run each solutions and check the results :-)
